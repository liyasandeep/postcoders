# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

-- If i had more time then i will refractor code to separate grid container logic into a component and also will do more specific error checking and a bit more styling to the cards.

-- Also i will try to change useEffect and try to use react query to reduce the api calls instead of using the Map. Had a look through react query but i am not sure if its the right way to implement cache in this case.

-- Also now the cache stores uppercase and lowercase postcodes separately and api calls are made for each of them, i would convert the user input to uppercase before setting the postcode in handleSubmit function,so that if user inputs in eithercase the api call is only made for first time.

-- Also i will add some comments to make it more readable for other uses
